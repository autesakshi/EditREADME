## DIAGNOSIS FOR PREDICTION OF KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS USING DEEP LEARNING

### GOAL
The Goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can detect if osteoarthritis 
is present or not along with this severity from a given  input of knee x-ray image.

### MODEL AND WORKING

#### Model:

The dataset consists of 1650 digital X-ray images of knee joint. The X-ray images are acquired using PROTEC PRS 500E X-ray machine. 
Original images are 8-bit grayscale image.  A novel approach has been developed to automatically extract the Cartilage region 
(region of interest) based on density of pixels. The target is to evaluate the performance of the deep learning algorithm to predict
per Kellgren and Lawrence grades.
