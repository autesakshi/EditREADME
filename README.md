## DIAGNOSIS FOR PREDICTION OF KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS USING DEEP LEARNING

### GOAL
The Goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can detect if osteoarthritis 
is present or not along with this severity from a given  input of knee x-ray image.

### MODEL AND WORKING

#### Model:
![image](https://github.com/autesakshi/EditREADME/assets/96119061/92faa2bc-e657-4502-8216-9e7b133d157b)

The dataset consists of 1650 digital X-ray images of knee joint. The X-ray images are acquired using PROTEC PRS 500E X-ray machine. 
Original images are 8-bit grayscale image.  A novel approach has been developed to automatically extract the Cartilage region 
(region of interest) based on density of pixels. The target is to evaluate the performance of the deep learning algorithm to predict
per Kellgren and Lawrence grades.

#### Working:


#### DEPENDENCY
Total no of files: The total number of files required to create this model are 6 files.

1]Static file:
This file is consist of 2 sub files which are 
          - .Css file
          - .js file
CSS and js files are used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

2]Templete file:
This file is consist of 2 sub files which are 
          - index.html file
          - base.html file
we have created this HTML file for creating Web pages
HTML file describes the structure of a Web page
HTML files are consists of a series of elements
HTML file elements tell the browser how to display the content

3]Test sample file:
This file is consist of different knee image of several type sech as doutfull,moderate,mild,etc 
we are using this images to predict the output weather the person is suffering from the dignosis or not
and at what stage
